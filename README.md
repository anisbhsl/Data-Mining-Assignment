#### Dataset: Blood Transfusion Service Center

##### Abstract:
Data taken from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City in Taiwan. The center passes their blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. To build a  model,748 donors were selected at random from the donor database. These 748 donor data, each one included R (Recency - months since last donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood).

### Clustering Methods
TC2
1. DBSCAN

#### Dataset: Bigbazar Customers clustering

##### Abstract:

The dataset consists of Big Bazar consumers. BigBazaar runs various loyalty programs, festive offers which provide their customer more opportunities to avail discounts. Customers can use these offers or loyalty program to either avail discount or make payment.This dataset contains products transaction information and highlights the discounts used by customers in each transaction. In this problem, we've to predict clusters of customers by store location. Knowing the set of customers that behave evenly will help them target their product promotions accordingly.
